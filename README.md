# Whoops!  Wrong repo!  

The CICD.sh project was released as an experiment.  It is available here:

Web Site: [https://www.cicd.sh](https://www.cicd.sh)

Repo: [https://github.com/FredLackey/cicd.sh](https://github.com/FredLackey/cicd.sh)

The location you're currently looking at is the **organization** repo that will hopefully contain the CICD.sh project someday... if there is a genuine interest and contributors, of course.

Head over there now.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Until then...

Thanx,  
Fred
